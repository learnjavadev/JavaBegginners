Sure, here is the rephrased version of the problems:

Problem 1:
Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the console and prints the larger number.

Problem 2:
Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the console and prints the smaller number.

Problem 3:
Write a program that checks whether a number is negative, positive, or zero.

Problem 4:
Write a Java program that checks if a given integer is a multiple of 5.

Problem 5:
Take the names and ages of three people as input from the user, determine the oldest and youngest among them, and print the results.

Problem 6:
Write a program that checks whether a number is even or odd.

Problem 7:
Write a program that takes a number as input from the console and checks if it is fully divisible by 2.

If it is, print "<number> is fully divisible by 2".
Otherwise, print "<number> is NOT fully divisible by 2".
Problem 8:
Take the length and breadth of a rectangle as input from the user and check if it is a square.

Problem 9:
A school has the following grading system rules:

Below 25: F
25 to 45: E
45 to 50: D
50 to 60: C
60 to 80: B
Above 80: A
Ask the user to enter marks and print the corresponding grade.

Problem 10:
Given:

x = 2
y = 5
z = 0
Find the values of the following expressions and print them:
a. x == 2
b. x != 5
c. x != 5 && y >= 5
d. z != 0 || x == 2
e. !(y < 10)

Problem 11:
Write a program in Java to input 5 numbers from the keyboard and calculate their sum and average.

Example:

Input: 1 2 3 4 5
Output:
The sum of 5 numbers is: 15
The average is: 3.0
Problem 12:
Write a Java program that accepts three numbers and checks if all numbers are equal or not.

Problem 13:
Write a Java program that reads a positive integer and counts the number of digits.

Problem 14:
Take a number as input and print the corresponding day of the week.

Example:

Input: 1
Output: Monday
Problem 15:
Take a number as input and check the following conditions:

If it is positive and a multiple of 3, print "number is positive and multiple of 5".
If it is greater than 50, print "number is also greater than 50", otherwise print "number is smaller than 50".
If it is negative, print "number is negative".
If it is zero, print "number is zero".
